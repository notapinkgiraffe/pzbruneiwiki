# Applications & Documents from the Government

This is a very broad category, I know, but this kind of stuff tends to be found all over the place, which I really don't care to re-host.

Check out these resources:

* [Concierge of Brunei](http://safwanah.wixsite.com/conciergeofbrunei/single-post/2015/08/20/summary-of-posts) - Resources compiled by individuals
