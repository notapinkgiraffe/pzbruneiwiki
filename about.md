## About

This is not a wiki, but a temporary site for me to store resources that I'd *like* to put into a Brunei-related wiki, possibly as an offshoot of [Open Brunei](http://openbrunei.org/).

Why didn't I just make the wiki? Idk. I overthink it and open dozens of browser tabs to research wiki services and engines and I never start the actual thing.

### Possible Questions

**Isn't Brunei already on Wikipedia?**

>Yes, but Wikipedia is itself *a wiki* and I am talking about creating *another wiki*. Wikis are online, publicly editable encylopedias - there are already lots of wikis around many themes and topics, such as [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Phuket_Town) for travel information, or wikis for TV shows like this [Arrested Development](http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Bluth's_Original_Frozen_Banana_Stand) wiki.
>
>So creating a new Brunei wiki wouldn't be a competitor to Wikipedia, but more of a repository of less 'notable' types of information about Brunei.

**Has there been a Brunei wiki before?**

>There was a project back in the 2000s to create a Brunei-specific wiki. I was invited to contribute, but I didn't really have the time for it back then. (Further info: [Maurina's 2006 post](https://iammaurina.com/2006/12/31/blogspeak-anyone-out-there-interested-on-doing-a-bruneian-wiki/), and [mohamednazmi's 2013 comment on its fate](http://openbrunei.org/2013/11/brunei-online-platform-websites/#comment-696))
>
>I am partly inspired by that project, also by the general concept of wikis, and my own attempt previously making a wiki for Brunei clubs/groups/associations. But it is also born out of my own frustrations, with finding - and recording - the pockets of information about Brunei that is all over the World Wide Web.

**Isn't there already a Brunei Resources?**

>Yes, and [Brunei Resources](http://bruneiresources.com/) is a great resource for information related to the Brunei government, and some information on Bruneian culture and history.
>
>So in my version of a Brunei wiki, it would be (much like Open Brunei) a resource for contemporary Brunei life, for more dynamic and often-changing information that may be hard to find in one place on the Internet. Perhaps [maps](lists/maps.html) created by the public? Perhaps a list of [English-language novels](lists/fiction-anglophone.html) written or based in Brunei?

**But everything here is mostly just links!** 

>Because we're on the internet, which is made up of links. :)
>
>I personally do not like re-hosting information from other websites. Website owners and contributors have worked hard to compile and present their information, and deserve to get traffic on their websites. It is also means I spend less time on copying & pasting, and more time collecting and organising links!
>
>In some cases, I do make copies of website content if I have reason to believe the website might not stay permanent. For example, Brunei government websites are notorious for changing their content or even their website structure (*cough*SharePoint*cough*), but without maintaining any permalinks. I will usually attempt to save such content on the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/).

**What's the point of gathering this information together?**

>What's the point of anything? Why create a blog? Why follow celebrities on Instagram? Why browse memes and why spend 30 mins a day browsing your social media feed?
>
>...Because information is beautiful, my friend, and I'd like information from and about Brunei to be accessible to everyone on the Internet. If I can help this happen, with the websites I build and the lists I compile, then that makes me a happier zebra.
