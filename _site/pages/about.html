  <h2>Brunei Wiki Sources - About </h2>

<div class="row-fluid">
  <div class="span12">
    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>This is not a wiki, but a temporary site for me to store resources that I’d <em>like</em> to put into a Brunei-related wiki, possibly as an offshoot of <a href="http://openbrunei.org/">Open Brunei</a>.</p>

<p>Why didn’t I just make the wiki? Idk. I overthink it and open dozens of browser tabs to research wiki services and engines and I never start the actual thing.</p>

<h3 id="possible-questions">Possible Questions</h3>

<p><strong>Isn’t Brunei already on Wikipedia?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, but Wikipedia is itself <em>a wiki</em> and I am talking about creating <em>another wiki</em>. Wikis are online, publicly editable encylopedias - there are already lots of wikis around many themes and topics, such as <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Phuket_Town">Wikivoyage</a> for travel information, or wikis for TV shows like this <a href="http://arresteddevelopment.wikia.com/wiki/Bluth's_Original_Frozen_Banana_Stand">Arrested Development</a> wiki.</p>

  <p>So creating a new Brunei wiki wouldn’t be a competitor to Wikipedia, but more of a repository of less ‘notable’ types of information about Brunei.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Has there been a Brunei wiki before?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a project back in the 2000s to create a Brunei-specific wiki. I was invited to contribute, but I didn’t really have the time for it back then. (Further info: <a href="https://iammaurina.com/2006/12/31/blogspeak-anyone-out-there-interested-on-doing-a-bruneian-wiki/">Maurina’s 2006 post</a>, and <a href="http://openbrunei.org/2013/11/brunei-online-platform-websites/#comment-696">mohamednazmi’s 2013 comment on its fate</a>)</p>

  <p>I am partly inspired by that project, also by the general concept of wikis, and my own attempt previously making a wiki for Brunei clubs/groups/associations. But it is also born out of my own frustrations, with finding - and recording - the pockets of information about Brunei that is all over the World Wide Web.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Isn’t there already a Brunei Resources?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes, and <a href="http://bruneiresources.com/">Brunei Resources</a> is a great resource for information related to the Brunei government, and some information on Bruneian culture and history.</p>

  <p>So in my version of a Brunei wiki, it would be (much like Open Brunei) a resource for contemporary Brunei life, for more dynamic and often-changing information that may be hard to find in one place on the Internet. Perhaps <a href="/maps">maps</a> created by the public? Perhaps a list of <a href="/fiction_anglophone">English-language novels</a> written or based in Brunei?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>But everything here is mostly just links!</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because we’re on the internet, which is made up of links. :)</p>

  <p>I personally do not like re-hosting information from other websites. Website owners and contributors have worked hard to compile and present their information, and deserve to get traffic on their websites. It is also means I spend less time on copying &amp; pasting, and more time collecting and organising links!</p>

  <p>In some cases, I do make copies of website content if I have reason to believe the website might not stay permanent. For example, Brunei government websites are notorious for changing their content or even their website structure (<em>cough</em>SharePoint<em>cough</em>), but without maintaining any permalinks. I will usually attempt to save such content on the <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What’s the point of gathering this information together?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s the point of anything? Why create a blog? Why follow celebrities on Instagram? Why browse memes and why spend 30 mins a day browsing your social media feed?</p>

  <p>…Because information is beautiful, my friend, and I’d like information from and about Brunei to be accessible to everyone on the Internet. If I can help this happen, with the websites I build and the lists I compile, then that makes me a happier zebra.</p>
