# Brunei Wiki Sources

[Brunei Wiki Sources](https://projects.possiblyzebra.net/pzbruneiwiki) - The Site

## About

_This is not a wiki, but a temporary site for me to store resources that I’d like to put into a Brunei-related wiki._

This was a mini-project of mine from around 2017. It was hosted on [Pancake.io](https://github.com/pancakeio), a Dropbox-powered static website generator. The service shut down sometime later and I transferred my files to GitHub.

I revived this repo in 2022 and got the site up and running under GitHub Pages. However, it's only here for archival purposes, as I'm currently working on other (similar and half-assed, haha) lists and compilation projects.

## Possible Questions

No one ever sends me questions, but if one of these is in your head...

* Isn’t Brunei already on Wikipedia?
* Has there been a Brunei wiki before?
* Isn’t there already a Brunei Resources?
* But everything here is mostly just links!
* What’s the point of gathering this information together?

I answer all of this on the [About](https://projects.possiblyzebra.net/pzbruneiwiki/about.html) page!
