# Clubs, Groups & Associations

The **Registry of Societies** (under the Royal Brunei Police Force) used to be online, browsable by category, and it was even possible to submit a registration application online. However, this website is no longer available online. (See: [2013 archive of the website](http://web.archive.org/web/20130422102334/https://ros.police.gov.bn/orbeon/society-home/welcome/))

* [Search Internet Archive for 'brunei associations'](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/*/brunei%20associations)
* [dir.proj.list](https://del.icio.us/hazm8/tag_bundle/dir.proj.list) / Clubs BN - This is my own project, drawn out over the years on multiple platforms, where I attempted to collect links to all Brunei clubs and associations that had any online presence. I abandoned the project in 2013ish; however, as of 2017, I am considering reviving this project.
