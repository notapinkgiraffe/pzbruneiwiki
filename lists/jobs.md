## General Online Places to find Job Listings

There are lots of classifieds & job listing websites out there, but back when I was jobhunting there was no single one that was more *definitive* or *consistent* than the others. Not sure if it's worth listing what can be easily Googled.

For now, check out this [list](http://safwanah.wixsite.com/conciergeofbrunei/single-post/2015/01/14/jobs-slash-employments) compiled by [Concierge of Brunei](http://safwanah.wixsite.com/conciergeofbrunei/).

Here are some other, more specific, online venues:

* [Jobs via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=&location=Brunei+Darussalam&trk=jobs_jserp_search_button_execute&orig=JSERP&applyLogin=&locationId=bn%3A0) located in Brunei Darussalam
* [Brunei Job Seekers Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/brujobseekers) on Facebook:<br>This is, to my knowledge, the largest group for Brunei job vacancies. Don't expect high-paying jobs here; expect to be humbled by the sheer amount of jobseekers and personal experiences sometimes shared by others. Just... please don't ask the group to inbox you about job opportunities.

## ICT Jobs

ICT-specific job boards:

* [GeekTurf](http://geekturf.net/jobs/)'s job board

Resources:

* [List of ICT companies with AAB Status](http://www.aiti.gov.bn/industrydevelopment/industrydevelopment-promotion/aabstatus-ictab/Pages/aabstatuslist.aspx):<br>The [AAB](http://www.aiti.gov.bn/industrydevelopment/industrydevelopment-promotion/aabstatus-ictab/Pages/aabstatus-ictab.aspx) is an accreditation scheme for local ICT businesses, and will cover small to large companies. Peruse and gather contact details for your job search. (There are of course businesses without AAB accreditation, but I'm sharing this list as it might be the most complete list of ICT companies in Brunei available online.)
